# SMA: Software Modeling and Analysis

![software-reengineering](sde-web.jpg)

This repo contains selected lecture material for the MSc level course “P2 -- Object-Oriented Design”.

Please note that there are additional guest lectures which are not included here.

## Description

Real software systems continuously evolve over time. As they evolve, they become harder to understand and maintain. In this course we will explore techniques to model complex software systems and analyze them to support program comprehension and reengineering tasks. Most lectures will combine theoretical background and practical application of tools and techniques. A portion of this course will make heavy use of Smalltalk, a live programming environment that supports advanced reflection metaprogramming techniques. Some material is based on two open‐source textbooks: Pharo by Example, and Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns.

## Learning Outcomes

After the successful completion of this course, you will:

- recognize the problems of legacy software
- use reflection and metaprogramming techniques
- extract software models from source code and other artifacts
- apply software metrics to detect quality problems
- visualize software to support program comprehension
- apply basic static and dynamic analysis techniques


## Slides

The slides have been prepared with Apple Keynote. Interspersed with the slideware are hidden slides containing notes for students. PDF versions of the slides can be found [here](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/lectures/p2/).

The figures for the slides have mostly been prepared using [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/).
