# SMA Moose Demo notes

Mtg w TG 2016-09-16

Need Java 8 for jdt2famix
(Could already start with MSE file)
Run jdt2famix from folder containing src and lib
Generates MSE and problems file.
Fix problems — unresolved method often means missing return type due to missing jar etc

Problem: which deprecated classes can I remove?
How would you solve this?
(find deprecated classes; find references; how do you do this?)
[Problem: searching won’t find you just the *classes*; there actually is a way in eclipse to search for deprecated classes!]
Insist on how exactly they would search!
How much time would it take you to solve this?
Get them to measure the clicks (eg in eclipse)
Convince them to look at software not as text but as models.

Load ArgoUML MSE
All model classes
view some
browse to blueprint and then to source
NB: the source is the *last* thing you see

Write a script:
self select: [: each | each isAnnotatedWith: 'Deprecated']
25 classes
NB: do *not* explain what you are doing!
Now select those with no clients.
self select: [ :each | each clientTypes notEmpty ]
We see 14 without clients. 
NB: take about ten minutes for discussion; but one a few minutes to actually solve the problem.
NOW ask who was able to follow what you were doing.

What to do about the rest
Check if the clients are deprecated?
On white board discuss.
Cases: deprecated class using deprecated; etc (3 cases at least)
Which case would you start with?

Q Why is this picture not in the IDE?
Write a Roassal to display the classes.
It’s not just a picture.
Add colours for deprecated ones.
Add edges.
Add force based layout.
Then see which non-deprecated classes are using deprecated ones.
This defines a workflow!
Now you can dive into the classes.
Look at all the views to see history of what we did. (Source code only at end.)

Task: need to investigate the ant (xml) files
Use a query to generate view of source file system
click to xml files
Task: how to find properties of ant files
Browsing source?
Pain point: scroll bar
Use XMLDOMParser to parse it, then view the tree
But don’t scroll through the tree
Use XPath to select the ones you want
Select all the views to see history of what we did.
Again, we see the source code only the end.

How do we discover the API?
eg clientTypes
Navigate through the model; switch to evaluator; type the code
How do you know that’s the code?
Go to navigator; right click to Utilities>Browse code implementing this navigation

# Moose Demo Notes

Importing
https://github.com/girba/jdt2famix
*** try this!

Fame - meta engine
FM3 - MOF-like metametamodel

Import MSE of ArgoUML

* Setting root folder does not seem to work
  - after setting, no change
  - the set dialog does not show the current setting
  * works when I build an MSE with jdt2famix of tictactoe
* also placing the source next to the image does not work
  - works for tictactoe

- FAMIX model

# FAQ

- How is MSE specified? How do you generate correct MSE?

- How can we explore the metamodel of an MSE file?
  - <http://www.themoosebook.org/book/internals/famix/meta-browser>

- Some visualisations appear to be missing
  - Side-by-side duplications
  - Namespace Dependencies
