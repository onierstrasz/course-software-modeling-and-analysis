# Call Graph demo (lecture 2)Calls.txt should be placed in the same location as the Pharo imageCallGraph-Demo-Playground.st initializes a Playground with snippets to executeVersions:- CallGraph-1.st : initial version after writing the first test (calls = list of lines)- CallGraph-2.st : code to create Call and JMethod, but missing methods to create in debugger from this snippet:		(CallGraph fromFile: ''Calls.txt'') methods size.- CallGraph-3.st : completed methods example with test method- CallGraph-4.st : added JClass and tests for polymorphic/static methods- CallGraph-5.st : added CallGraphFileTestNB: the demo assumes Calls.txt uses carriage returns, not line feeds
